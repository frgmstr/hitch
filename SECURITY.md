# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The Hitch profile is versioned via Git tags. All published releases
receive security updates for the latest minor version. Older tagged
releases are **not** guaranteed to receive patches — upgrade if you're
running an old release and need a fix.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| main    | ✅ Yes             |
| v0.x.x  | ⚠️ Last tagged only |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Hitch, please report it
responsibly. **Do not open a public GitHub issue.**

### How to Report

Email your findings to the maintainer with:

- A clear description of the vulnerability and its impact
- Steps to reproduce (PoC if possible)
- The version/commit you tested against

### What to Expect

| Phase | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Initial triage | Within 48 hours |
| Confirmation / request for more info | Within 7 days |
| Fix developed & released | Varies by severity |

You will receive a response within **48 hours**. If the vulnerability is
confirmed, we'll work with you on a fix and coordinate the release. We
ask that you do not publicly disclose details until a patch is available.

### Scope

In scope: code in this repository (skills/, scripts/, config.yaml, etc.)
that could expose user data or compromise their Hermes Agent instance.

Out of scope: issues with third-party services (Visor.vin API, browser
providers) — report those to the respective vendors.
